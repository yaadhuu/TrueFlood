# Skill Reviewer

Review agent skills against best practices and rewrite weak areas.

## When to Use

- After writing or editing a SKILL.md
- Before publishing a skill to agentskill.sh or sharing with a team
- When a skill underperforms (low ratings, poor triggering, inconsistent output)
- When asked to audit, review, or improve a skill

## Review Process

### Step 1: Read the Skill

Read the full SKILL.md and all referenced files (references/, scripts/, assets/).
Note the skill's purpose, target audience, and complexity.

### Step 2: Score Against 10 Dimensions

Evaluate each dimension on a 1-5 scale using the rubric in [references/rubric.md](references/rubric.md).

```
Skill Review: <skill-name>

| # | Dimension              | Score | Key Issue                        |
|---|------------------------|-------|----------------------------------|
| 1 | Frontmatter            | ?/5   |                                  |
| 2 | Description Quality    | ?/5   |                                  |
| 3 | Conciseness            | ?/5   |                                  |
| 4 | Structure              | ?/5   |                                  |
| 5 | Instruction Clarity    | ?/5   |                                  |
| 6 | Freedom Calibration    | ?/5   |                                  |
| 7 | Error Handling         | ?/5   |                                  |
| 8 | Progressive Disclosure | ?/5   |                                  |
| 9 | Scripts Quality        | ?/5   |                                  |
|10 | Completeness           | ?/5   |                                  |

Overall: ?/50
```

### Step 3: List Specific Issues

For each dimension scoring 3 or below, list concrete issues:

```
### Issues

1. [D2] Description is 15 characters, too vague to trigger reliably
2. [D3] Lines 45-80 explain what a CSV is; the agent already knows this
3. [D6] Three PDF libraries listed as equal options; pick a default
```

### Step 4: Rewrite Problem Areas

For each issue, show the current text and a rewritten version.
Apply changes directly if the user asks for it, otherwise present as suggestions.

```
### Fix: [D2] Description too vague

BEFORE:
description: Helps with PDFs.

AFTER:
description: >
  Extract text and tables from PDF files, fill PDF forms, merge
  documents. Use when working with PDF files or when the user
  mentions PDFs, forms, or document extraction.
```

### Step 5: Estimate Token Impact

Count approximate tokens for the full SKILL.md body (excluding frontmatter).
Flag if over 5,000 tokens with specific sections to move to references/.

## Scoring Reference

The full rubric with examples is in [references/rubric.md](references/rubric.md).

Quick thresholds:
- **40-50/50**: Production-ready. Minor polish at most.
- **30-39/50**: Good foundation. Address flagged issues before publishing.
- **20-29/50**: Needs significant work. Multiple dimensions require rewriting.
- **Below 20/50**: Fundamental issues. Consider restructuring from scratch.

## Common Fixes (Quick Reference)

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Description too vague | Add what it does + when to use it + trigger keywords |
| Description uses first/second person | Rewrite in third person imperative |
| Explains things the agent already knows | Delete. Only add what the agent lacks. |
| Multiple equal options presented | Pick a default, mention alternatives briefly |
| No examples provided | Add 1-2 input/output pairs |
| Deeply nested file references | Flatten to one level from SKILL.md |
| SKILL.md over 500 lines | Move reference material to references/ |
| Magic numbers in scripts | Add comments explaining why each value |
| Scripts fail silently | Add explicit error messages with guidance |
| No validation step in workflow | Add a validate-then-proceed loop |
| Time-sensitive information | Remove dates, use "current" / "legacy" sections |
| Inconsistent terminology | Pick one term per concept, use throughout |
| No frontmatter name field | Add name (lowercase, hyphens, max 64 chars) |
| No frontmatter description | Add description (max 1024 chars) |
| Windows-style paths | Replace backslashes with forward slashes |
